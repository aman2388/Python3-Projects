# Python3-Projects

A list of projects I have worked on using the skills I learned from an online course called "The Data Science Course 2020: Complete Data Science Bootcamp" taught by 365 Careers, 365 Careers Team.

The dataset sources I used for practice purposes were Kaggle and UCI Machine Learning Repository.



## Absenteeism Module

This is an exercise that addresses Absenteeism at a company during work time. More precisely, it shows whether or not an employee can be expected to be missing for a specific number of hours in a given work day. This exercise involves preprocessing the raw data, create a Logistic Regression model, deploy the model through a module and analyse the predicted outputs in Tableau.

## Credit Card Fraud Detection
A machine learning model that recognizes fraudulent credit card transactions, using TensorFlow framework. The main idea is that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

## Image Classification - Deep Neural Network
An image classification algorithm, designed to tell if an image contains a human figure or a horse.

## Linear Regression Practice
#### Car Sales Exercise
A practical example made with 365 Data Science Bootcamp, that predicts the price of a used car depending on its specifications.

#### Salary Data Prediction
A basic Linear Regression model that I created for practice. It predicts the Salary based on the years of experience of an employee.

#### Student Final Grade Prediction
A Linear Regression Model that predicts the final grade of a student based on their performance throughout the year.

## Logistic Regression Practice
#### Heart Attack Prediction
Some practice I have done, after gaining knowlegde from'Logistic Regression' section from the Bootcamp. The model allows us to predict the chances of a person getting a heart attack.
